        Hi, Iâ€™m Winnie the creator of {{ config('app.name') }}. 
        The main purpose of this website is to help people like me
        who read Manga/Manhwa/Manhua across multiple different website to
        manage all in one place. By bookmarking the Manga/Manhwa/Manhua you will
        get notified once a new chapter is release. 
        Disclaimer, this is not a website where you can read Manga/Manhwa/Manhua it only redirects 
        you to the source of the new release or updates. Soo it's more of like a blog/news that notifies you
        everytime a new chapter is realease. You can register {!! anchorNewTab('/register', 'here') !!}. You can contact me also at the 
        {!! anchorNewTab('/contact-me', 'contact') !!}
        page menu.
    </p>

        If you see your website links here and you want it to be remove, then please send me a message.
